 *
 * You are given a doubly linked list which in addition to the next and previous pointers,
 * it could have a child pointer, which may or may not point to a separate doubly linked list.
 *
 * These child lists may have one or more children of their own, and so on, to produce a multilevel data structure, as shown in the example below.
 *
 * Flatten the list so that all the nodes appear in a single-level, doubly linked list. You are given the head of the first level of the list.
 *
 * Example 1:
 *
 * Input: head = [1,2,3,4,5,6,null,null,null,7,8,9,10,null,null,11,12]
 * Output: [1,2,3,7,8,11,12,9,10,4,5,6]
 *
 * Example 2:
 * Input: head = [1,2,null,3]
 * Output: [1,3,2]
 * Explanation:
 *
 * The input multilevel linked list is as follows:
 *
 *   1---2---NULL
 *   |
 *   3---NULL
 *
 * Example 3:
 * Input: head = []
 * Output: []
 *
