 * Write a class StockSpanner which collects daily price quotes for some stock, and returns the span of that stock's price for the current day.
 *
 * The span of the stock's price today is defined as the maximum number of consecutive days (starting from today and going backwards)
 * for which the price of the stock was less than or equal to today's price.
 *
 * For example, if the price of a stock over the next 7 days were [100, 80, 60, 70, 60, 75, 85], then the stock spans would be [1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 4, 6].
 *
 *
 * Example 1:
 *
 * Input: ["StockSpanner","next","next","next","next","next","next","next"], [[],[100],[80],[60],[70],[60],[75],[85]]
 * Output: [null,1,1,1,2,1,4,6]
 * Explanation:
 * First, S = StockSpanner() is initialized.  Then:
 * S.next(100) is called and returns 1,
 * S.next(80) is called and returns 1,
 * S.next(60) is called and returns 1,
 * S.next(70) is called and returns 2,
 * S.next(60) is called and returns 1,
 * S.next(75) is called and returns 4,
 * S.next(85) is called and returns 6.
 *
 * Note that (for example) S.next(75) returned 4, because the last 4 prices
 * (including today's price of 75) were less than or equal to today's price.
 *
 *
 * Note:
 *
 * Calls to StockSpanner.next(int price) will have 1 <= price <= 10^5.
 * There will be at most 10000 calls to StockSpanner.next per test case.
 * There will be at most 150000 calls to StockSpanner.next across all test cases.
 * The total time limit for this problem has been reduced by 75% for C++, and 50% for all other languages.
